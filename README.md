# v___iArchitecture
Distributed architecture for a company. This is very tentative, based on details that I gathered or inferred from a few podcasts and panels. 

I have been obsessing the past few days about an ecommerce company that does B2B and B2C sales. They are mostly a catalog platform for suppliers that don't have a lot of ecommerce surface and are really good at adapting to supplier needs and circumstances. Supposedly you can fax your PIM and it will get into the catalog. Prasing a spreadsheet is really tricky! How do you manage inputs from these crazy sources? How do you hydrate sparse data and efficiently get supplier approval? It sounds like building out the catalog is the principal challenge right now, but I believe they will need a rules engine and an approval flow to do it at scale. 

Ingestion
Input streams should be consolidated as early in the pipeline as possible, while storing the raw submissions and monitoring a DLQ for mapping failures. 

Rule Engine
This rule engine will require three layers. A rule layer, a scope layer, and a role-based policy layer. Rules will need their own approval flow, in addition to the change approval flow, so that a supplier can set policy for change approvals and speed the process along. It would probably be best to add a rule translation layer, so that rule creation can be goverened and the rule engine can be adapted or swapped out. 

ML enrichment
Sparse product data can be enriched using similar products, in some cases. A clustering service that provides hierarchical data would help with sorting and categorizing so that they are discoverable, these groupings or centroids would also help with replacement reccomendations and deduplication.
